      I am <strong>27 years old</strong> and this is my <strong>5th year at CSUN</strong>. I was in the <strong>Marine Corps</strong> for 5 years. 
      I went straight to boot camp <strong>2 days after I graduated high school</strong> in 2016 at Grover Cleveland High School.<br>
      Thanks to being in the Marine Corps I was able to travel the world, visiting <strong>15 different countries</strong> 
      and living in <strong>Japan for 2 years</strong>. This is where I developed my passion for traveling, and I’ve made it a mission 
      to travel at least <strong>twice a year</strong> and try to visit Japan every year.<br>
      After enrolling in school I was fortunate enough to get a pet dog named <strong>Asuna</strong>. She is an <strong>Australian Shepherd</strong> 
      and honestly feels like my child. She’s almost 3 years old and has had 2 litters with my roommate’s dog <strong>Tato</strong> (short for Potato).<br>
      I love movies, especially <strong>cheesy B-rated horror films</strong>. I’m not sure why, but they always make me laugh. 
      I also enjoy learning new hobbies—so far I’ve picked up <em>crocheting</em>, making <em>miniature paper theater art</em>, 
      <em>gardening</em>, and growing <em>bonsai trees</em> I love being in the <em>outdoors</em>, ill take any chance to go on a hike when i travel
      or go to the ocean for a quick swim.
