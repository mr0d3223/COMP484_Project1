            <p>Out of all the countries I have the most time spent in Japan, living there for 2 years while I was in the Marine Corps and 
            just having visited last New Years and with hopes of going again this New Years. It is a life changing experience and I highly 
            recommend this being one of the must travel locations. The food is unrealistically amazing and is nothing but a movie moment in
            you life. The Culture is amazing, I had no clue that Japan has one of the best night lifes i have ever been to from basically going 
            clubbing from sun down to sun up, amazing bars and street life vendors.

            <p>New Zealand has to be one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. The scenery is something out of a movie with how 
              unrealistic it beauty is. The climate is perfect for doing almost anything outdoors. This is where i went bungie jumping for 
              the first time and it was into a beautiful crystal clear lake. This has to be one of my dream retirement locations for its amazing 
              outdoor activities. Since there is no language barrier it makes so much easier to travel and enjoy the experience. I also got lucky 
              enough to visit the set of <em>Lord of the rings</em> Hobbit town and it was an amazing experience!

            <p>I was fortunate enough to visit Australia twice one on vacation and once during a work trip while in the Marine Corps. This is 
              where I was lucky enough to go with a group of friends to Sydney and go sky diving for the first time. The beaches are beautiful 
              even though I had a close encounter with a jellyfish I did not that discourage me from explore more. I also got to enjoy the 
              nightlife here and was surprised as to how similar it is to LA nightlife.

            <p>I was so beautiful being in Costa Rica, I went with a friend and the both of us had a blast doing snorkeling hikes, odoing tours 
            of the indigenous people. It very much reminded me of my families home country of Nicaragua with many of the foods being similar. The 
            warm tropical weather brought relaxation throughout my body. We picked a pretty remote small town to visit so we were able to do a lot 
            in the 2 weeks we were down there.</p>

            <p>The Philippines was a whole experience. I initially went down there for my first combat deployment. So for the first 6 months that
            I was down there I was mainly working, but after my deployment finished we were allowed to explore more of Manila and that was a liberating
            experience after working like a dog with 16 hour shift. We did a lot of tours to famous spots to learn more about the culture. The food was 
            amazing I even tried Balut which is a unique dish in the Phillipines, it was suprisingly good or at least the one I ate was good. There
            were so many concerts going on while I was down there and I even went to a night club that had Deadmau5 performing.

            <p>Bali was so beautiful with its landscapes and activities that I had the opportunity to visit. Even going to a buddhist temple.
              The night life was amazing, my friends and I went out every night to a different club and tried all sort of new drinks some of which 
              were on fire when served. This is also where I rode a motorcycle for the first time, and it was terrible I almost crashed with how 
              crazy the driving is down there, but im still alive and would do it again.

            <p>Hawaii is everything that everyone says about it! I am fortunate enough to have one of my Marine Corps buddies who lives there
            and because of that the last two times I went down there I didnt have to pay for lodging since him and his girlfriend let me stay 
            with them. I took my buddy to go surfing for the first time, we both aced it the first few tries. I was able to go to <em>Kualoa Ranch</em>
            This is where they shoot almost all movies that have a tropical scene and i even did a horseback riding tour through the movie sets.
            My buddy and his girlfriend are huge ravers and they were able to get me into some big festivals down there for almost free and take me to many 
            underground party scenes. I usually went on my own adventure to beaches or hiking when they went to work so it was a beautiful experience.
